# TASK 1: Use subprocess to grep for "Failed password" in /var/log/titan_sim/auth_sim.log
# Ensure you capture the output and convert it to text!
# YOUR CODE HERE:
result = subprocess.run(["grep", "Failed password", "/var/log/titan_sim/auth_sim.log"], capture_output = True, text = True)
raw_output = result.stdout

# TASK 2: Parse the captured output to extract ONLY the attacking IP addresses.
# Hint: Loop through each line, split the line by spaces, and grab index [10].
# Save the IPs to a Python List called attacker_ips.
# YOUR CODE HERE:
# Turn the text block into list of individual lines
lines = raw_output.split('\n')

# Create an empty list to hold attack IPs
attack_ips = []

# Loop through each line
for line in  lines:
	# only process lines that have content
	if line:
		# Split by spaces, grab the IP at index 10
		ip = line.split(" ")[10]
		attack_ips.append(ip)

# TASK 3: Create a dictionary containing the extracted IPs and export it to 'threat_report.json'
# Dictionary format: {"alert_type": "Brute Force", "attacker_ips": attacker_ips}
# YOUR CODE HERE:
alert_data = { "alert_type": "Brute Force", "attacker_ips": attack_ips}

# Write file
with open("threat_report.json", "w") as file:
	json.dump(alert_data, file, indent=4)
